GrantView,The Cancer Cell Map Initiative,CA209891,"Cancer research is increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types. The CCMI will leverage advanced interaction mapping and computational facilities which have been established at two University of California campuses (UCSF and UC San Diego) to generate, assemble and analyze cancer networks, focusing initially on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer.<br><br>There now exists a vast amount of sequence data from tumors associated with many different cancer types, and efforts are ongoing to extract mechanistic insight from this information. Given all of this progress, what is now needed is an integrated computational and experimental strategy that will help place these alterations into context of the higher order biological mechanisms in cancer cells. This is the goal of the Cancer Cell Map Initiative, which will create a resource that can be used for cancer genome interpretation. This will allow us to identify key complexes and pathways to be studied in greater mechanistic detail to get a deeper understanding about the biology underlying different cancer states. Genomic data derived from tumor sequencing studies identifies key genes implicated in different cancer cells. Integrated physical and genetic networks based on these factors will help put the mutations into biological context, enabling the discovery of new disease genes as interacting partners become apparent. Ultimately, all of this knowledge will translate into improved ability to stratify and treat patients based on the particular networks that are altered.",U54,"Heterogeneity, Evolution, Drug Resistance/Sensitivity","University of California, San Diego, University of California, San Francisco","UCSD, UCSF","Nevan Krogan, Trey Ideker, David Agard, Prashant Mali, Jill P.

GrantView,Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology,CA225088,"The Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CCSP) based at Harvard Medical School focuses on constructing and validating network-level models of responsiveness and resistance (innate and acquired) to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and small molecule (targeted) therapies in human cancer. The over-arching goal is to improve the treatment of disease and advance molecular understanding of oncogenic transformation and opposing immune surveillance on the initiation and progression of human cancer. Our Center also studies the adverse effects of targeted therapies, with an initial focus on ICI toxicity in the skin.<br><br>Our approach involves the use of systems pharmacology tools and concepts to address the most significant questions encountered in the use of ICIs and targeted therapies individually and in combination in melanoma, in which both classes of drug can be highly effective individually, and also in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in which clinical responses are sporadic. In the long-term, expected outcomes include (i) translating clinical problems in melanoma, TNBC and GBM from the bedside to bench and then back to the bedside via new drug-disease pairings, drug combinations and response biomarkers (ii) developing, validating and applying to clinical trials innovative pharmacological concepts that consider the impact of cell-to-cell variability, micro environment, and dose and drug sequencing on outcomes and (iii) reducing the burden of therapy through improved understanding of mechanism-based drug toxicities and ways of mitigating them.",U54,"Drug Resistance/Sensitivity, Microenvironment",Harvard University,Harvard,"Peter Sorger, Sameer Chopra, Conor Evans, Keith Flaherty, Jennifer Guerriero, Marcia Haigis, Steve Hodi, Benjamin Izar, Darrell Irvine, Douglas A.

GrantView,Steady States and Cellular Transitions Associated with Carcinogenesis and Tumor Progression,CA217655,"Cellular transitions between two distinct states are fundamental to many steps of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Such transitions are broadly studied, but general models have been historically limited to qualitative descriptions. This contrasts with phase transitions in physical systems, such as the transition between ferro- and paramagnetic states, which are well characterized within the context of the physico-chemical laws, and can be partially understood, in a predictive capacity, using simple, precise models such as the Ising model. Such models are based upon a system of interacting lattice sites. A parameter (e.g. temperature) is varied, and the fluctuations of the lattice sites are analyzed as the system approaches and passes through a critical point. These models are largely independent of many details of the specific system under study; the critical system-specific details are captured in the interactions between the lattice sites. Nevertheless, they can yield specific predictions that can, in principle, be experimentally verified, such as increased fluctuations in the vicinity of the critical point, and the loss of one or more degrees of freedom at the critical point. Ising-like in silico models have guided theoretical studies of transitions in various gene or protein regulatory networks, although resultant predictions can be challenging to experimentally test.<br><br>We seek a potentially general approach where the experimental input is a statistically large number of single cell measurements, with many analytes quantitatively measured from each cell. From this data we capture the fluctuations and thereby determine the correlations of many analytes. In an Ising model analogy, such measurements define the site interactions. These inputs permit straightforward theoretic models for resolving cellular steady states, transitions between steady states, and for making testable predictions. Studies of the chemically-induced-carcinogenesis transition are provided as preliminary data/proof of concept. For Aim 1, we develop a picture of cancer cell steady states using integrated metabolic and proteomic single cell assays. In Aims 2 and 3, we expand this approach to two apparent cellular transitions associated with cancer drug resistance: the adaptation of heterogeneous brain cancers to certain targeted inhibitors, and a drug-induced cellular de-differentiation observed in melanomas (and other tumors) in response to immunotherapy and targeted inhibitors. All aims are joint experiment/theory aims. Aims 2-3 involve in vivo testing of predictions.",U01,"Drug Resistance/Sensitivity, Tumor-Immune, Metabolism","Institute for Systems Biology, University of California, Los Angeles","ISB, UCLA","James Heath, Wei Wei",PS-ON
